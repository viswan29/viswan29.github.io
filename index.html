    <h1>Hey Whatsup! Welcome to my world.</h1>
    <h2>Professional Details</h2>
    <p>Graduated in 2013 and joined in Infosys in 2014<br>
    My journey started in Mysore training campus, one of the mesmarizing sites and that is my first experience with programming. <br>
    Was given Mainframes technology to train and work in production. Worked in the field for 2 years and later thought Mainframes is 
    legacy application and started to learn other technologies as i'm more interested in data, learnt Python and then data science.<br>
    I love working in data fields, have worked on many projects related to Data Analytics, Data Engineering and Data Science
